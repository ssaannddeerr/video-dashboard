## 🛠️ Technology Stack

- **Electron** - Cross-platform desktop application framework
- **HLS.js** - JavaScript library for HLS video streaming
- **Node.js** - JavaScript runtime environment
- **HTML5/CSS3** - Modern web technologies for UI
- **JavaScript** - Application logic and video management

## 📋 Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16 or higher recommended)
- npm (comes with Node.js)

## 🚀 Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/video-dashboard.git
   cd video-dashboard
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Run the application:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

## 📦 Building

Build the application for your platform:

```bash
# For macOS
npm run build:mac

# For Windows
npm run build:win

# For Linux
npm run build:linux
```

The built application will be available in the `dist/` directory.

## 🎥 Video Sources

The application currently displays:
- Prague city webcam (Skyline Webcams)
- EarthTV live stream
- Multiple YouTube live streams (news, scenery, etc.)
- Placeholder slots for additional feeds

**Note:** Some video stream URLs may expire and need to be refreshed periodically. YouTube stream URLs typically expire after a few hours and can be refreshed using `yt-dlp`:

```bash
yt-dlp -f 'best' -g 'YOUTUBE_URL' 2>/dev/null
```

## ⚙️ Configuration

Video sources can be configured in `src/renderer/renderer.js`. Look for the initialization code for each video element and update the stream URLs as needed.

## 🔒 Security

This application follows Electron security best practices:
- Context isolation enabled
- Node integration disabled in renderer
- Content Security Policy implemented
- Web security enabled

## 🐛 Known Issues

- YouTube stream URLs expire after a few hours and require manual refresh
- Some webcam feeds may require authentication tokens that expire
